```
=== QLAWS HAM CONTINUATION MODE ===

READ AND EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING STEPS IN ORDER:

1. READ ALL DOCUMENTATION:
   - Read PRD.md completely - understand all 12 PRDs and 72 phases
   - Read tracking.md completely - understand current progress status
   - Read README.md for project overview and goals

2. IDENTIFY CURRENT STATE:
   - Check tracking.md "CURRENT STATUS OVERVIEW" table
   - Find current PRD number and phase number
   - Review which modules are ✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, or ⏳ Pending

3. VALIDATE COMPLETED WORK:
   - For each completed phase, verify:
     a) All source files exist in correct paths
     b) All tests pass (run test suite)
     c) All integrations work (import/export verification)
     d) Hash verification passes for computations
   - If ANY validation fails: FIX before proceeding

4. CONTINUE FROM CURRENT PHASE:
   - If current phase is incomplete: Complete it
   - If current phase is complete: Move to next phase
   - Follow PRD.md specifications exactly
   - Follow dependency order strictly (Level 0 → Level 13)

5. IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
   - NEVER use placeholders, mock data, or simulated logic
   - NEVER skip tests - minimum requirements per PRD
   - ALWAYS generate SHA-256 hash for computations
   - ALWAYS update tracking.md after completing each module
   - ALWAYS verify integration before moving forward

6. AFTER EACH MODULE COMPLETION:
   - Run all unit tests for the module
   - Run integration tests with dependent modules
   - Generate hash verification proof
   - Update tracking.md:
     * Change module status from ⏳ to ✅
     * Update test counts
     * Add integration hash
     * Update "CURRENT STATUS OVERVIEW"
   - Commit changes with descriptive message

7. PHASE COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
   - [ ] All modules in phase implemented
   - [ ] All unit tests pass (100%)
   - [ ] All integration tests pass (100%)
   - [ ] Hash verification complete
   - [ ] tracking.md updated
   - [ ] Ready for next phase

8. ERROR HANDLING:
   - If test fails: Debug and fix before proceeding
   - If integration fails: Check import names, class names, signatures
   - If hash mismatch: Investigate and resolve
   - Document all issues in tracking.md "Integration Issues" section

EXECUTE NOW: Start by reading PRD.md and tracking.md, then continue development.

## 🎯 Development Strategy (Best Path to 100% Goals)

### Phase 1: Foundation (PRD-01)
Build zero-dependency modules first (Logger, HashVerifier), then mathematical primitives.

### Phase 2: Quantum Framework (PRD-02 to PRD-04)
Implement quantum mechanics, spacetime mathematics, and Planck-scale physics.

### Phase 3: Revolutionary Research (PRD-05 to PRD-07)
Develop unified theories, revolutionary formulas, and massive testing framework.

### Phase 4: Validation & Discovery (PRD-08 to PRD-10)
Build quantum computer simulator, scientific validation, and discovery engine.

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Deployment (PRD-11 to PRD-12)
Synthesize world-changing formulas and complete final integration.
